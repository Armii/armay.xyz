            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>Hi there, I'm Alfie! I'm an 18 year old ex computer science student and current Forensics and Security student slowly learning more things about development. I have learned basic C# in school and also recently started with using HTML/CSS. I've really enjoyed making all sorts of stuff even though I'm completely terrible at coding. I recently finished studying at the Elliott Hudson College, UK.</p>

            <p>With C# I can make simple console applications. In addition to this, I have developed a small Unity game called 'Veggies'; the game revolves around you surviving waves of evil vegetables (download coming soon??). Additionally, I have also made a very basic Discord bot using Node.js and the Discord.js framework.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am attending Leeds Beckett University where I'm studying Computer Forensics and Security. I'm hoping to follow this path further where I will hopefully be able to grab myself a career within this sector.</p>

            <p>This is a small section about the context behind this small website. I have been given a task to create something with lots of juicy information about the fundimentals of HTML5!</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>I have taken part in many of my own and collaberative projects over the years. Some of them are listed here:</p>
            <ul id="projects">
                <li><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> Veggies Unity Game</li>
                <li><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> Spleef.PW Minecraft Network</li>
                <li><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> Previous website (Armay.xyz)</li>
                <li><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> Current website!</li>
                <li><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> More to come??</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Other</h2>
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing games such as COD, GTA V, Minecraft, Among Us, Satisfactory and FiveM! I also know how to ice skate which is pretty cool I guess.</p>
            <p>It is really hard to think of some words to be able to fill this entire column full of letters and words that are totally needed and not irrelevant to anything.</p>
            <p>If you ever feel like playing some games or anything, I'm always up for a chat! Just hmu on Discord (username at the bottom of the page) :^) </p>
